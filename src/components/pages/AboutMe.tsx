      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer and C# / .NET Developer currently pursuing Engineer's Degree in Computer Science at Lodz University of Technology, a person who loves to code and get known with new technologies, but that's obvious. Beside that I am in love with PlayStation and playing video games. I really enjoy doing Calisthenics. I am also into Cars, mainly Porsche.
